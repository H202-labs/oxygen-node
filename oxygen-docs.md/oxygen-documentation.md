# 🧬 OXYGEN: Core Documentation for MVP to Ecosystem

> *A culturally tuned, trust-engineered digital Ajo ecosystem for the next-gen Naija hustler.*

---

## **1. 🔥 OXYGEN Core Philosophy**

**OXYGEN isn’t just a digital savings app — it’s a behavioral economy powered by community trust, gamified discipline, and culturally rooted financial rituals.**

We are not mimicking traditional banking. We are digitizing and scaling the *Ajo mindset*, giving it superpowers:

* 🌍 **Community-first savings**
* 🤝 **Accountability through real behavior**
* 🎮 **Gamified trust mechanics**
* 🔐 **Smart protections against selfish exits**
* 🚀 **Unlockable features based on consistency**

### Trust Score Dictates Access:

| Trust % | Can Join... | Auto Invest? | Cluster Creation? |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 0–20%   | None        | ❌            | ❌                 |
| 21–40%  | Public ₦1k  | ❌            | ❌                 |
| 41–60%  | All         | ✅            | ❌                 |
| 61–80%  | Mid/High ₦  | ✅            | 1 active cluster  |
| 81–100% | Everything  | Full control | Up to 3 clusters  |

### Auto-Invest Rules:

* 20% of payouts locked by default
* Unlockable only if **not in any active cluster**
* Withdraw early? Reset Trust to 20%
* Invested into micro-clusters via CLM Bot

✅ Your Trust Score affects:

* Which clusters you can join
* Whether you're allowed to **leave a cycle early**
* Whether **auto invest** is accessible
* Your **payout position priority**

---

## **14. 🧠 AI Cluster Liquidity Manager (CLM Bot)**

This bot:

* Creates **invisible micro-clusters** from pooled auto-invest capital
* Redistributes small chunks into the network
* Handles emergency payouts if someone defaults
* Can **delay a user’s payout** by 24h if insufficient coverage exists — then adjusts trust rating subtly

- Invisible bot-powered rebalancer
- Builds micro-clusters from idle auto-invest funds
- Ensures backup liquidity for payouts
- Delays payouts by 24h if network-wide capital is strained
