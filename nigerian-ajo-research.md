### Nigerian AJO — A Comprehensive Report on Everything You Need to Know

---

#### What is AJO?

AJO, also known as Esusu, Adashe, Osusu, or contribution, is a trust-based informal group savings program deeply rooted in Nigerian and West African culture. It represents one of the oldest forms of Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs).

The term "AJO" is derived from Yoruba, while other ethnic groups have different names:

- **Cha** (Igbo)  
- **Adashi** (Hausa, Tiv)  
- **Bam** (Tiv)  
- **Isusu** (Ot)  
- **Utu** (Igbo)  
- **Dashi** (Nupe)  
- **Efe** (Ibibio)  
- **Oku** (Kalabari Ijawas)  
- **Mitiri / Compiri**

#### How AJO Works: The Complete System

##### Basic Structure and Operation

- Members contribute fixed sums regularly to a common fund.
- Each member takes turns collecting the entire sum during each cycle.
